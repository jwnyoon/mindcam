# Mindcam
MindCam is an application for Google Glass. 
It captures the memorable moments automatically by detecting your head's movement. 
This project is the final project of Surveillance Documentary Class at NYU ITP (2014 Spring Semester).

This application is getting accelerometer value inside of Google Glass to detect head movement. 
I assumed that since google glass is head mounted, it could detect our intentions effectively. 
From several trials, I found that when I felt interested in something, the range of accelerometer values are relatively high. 
I defined a threshold based on that to trigger the camera action.
